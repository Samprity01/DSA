Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

 

Example 1:

Input :
N = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares
less than 9. So, the Output is 2.


class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int N) {
        // code here
        int i=1;
        while(i<N){
            int sq=i*i;
            if(sq>=N){
                break;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return i-1;
    }
};
