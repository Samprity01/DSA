Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 33.75%Submissions: 313K+Points: 2
Given a sorted array arr[] of size n without duplicates, and given a value x. Floor of x is defined as the largest element k in arr[] such that k is smaller than or equal to x. Find the index of k(0-based indexing).

Examples

Input: n = 7, x = 0 arr[] = {1,2,8,10,11,12,19}
Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than 0 is found. So output is "-1".





class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find floor of x
    // n: size of vector
    // x: element whose floor is to find
    int findFloor(vector<long long> &v, long long n, long long x) {

        // Your code here
      
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(v[i] > x)
                break;
        }
        return i-1;
    }
};
