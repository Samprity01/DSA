You have given two sorted arrays arr1[] & arr2[] of distinct elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.

Note: 0-based indexing is followed.




class Solution {
  public:
    int findExtra(int n, int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        // add code here.
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr1[i]!=arr2[i]){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
        
    }
};
