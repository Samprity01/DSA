Given an array arr of size N and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr = [3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3]
k = 4
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.




class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
    int countOccurence(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        // Your code here
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            mp[arr[i]]++;
            
        }
        
       int count=0;
       for(auto i:mp){
           if(i.second>(n/k)){
               count++;
           }
       }
       return count;
        
    }
};
