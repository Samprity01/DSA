Given a string s without spaces, a character ch and an integer count. Your task is to return the substring that remains after the character ch has appeared count number of times.
Note:  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(Empty string) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

Examples:

Input: s = "Thisisdemostring", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ng
Explanation: The remaining substring of s after the 3rd
occurrence of 'i' is "ng", hence the output is ng.


class Solution {
  public:

    string printString(string s, char ch, int count) {
        // Your code goes here
        int occ = 0, i;

        // Start traversing the string
        for (i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {

            // Increment occ if current char is equal
            // to given character
            if (s[i] == ch)
                occ++;

            // Break the loop if given character has
            // been occurred given no. of times
            if (occ == count)
                break;
        }

        // Print the string after the occurrence
        // of given character given no. of times
        if (i < s.length() - 1)
            return s.substr(i + 1, s.length() - (i + 1));

        // Otherwise string is empty
        else
            return "";
    }
};
